# Curve-Fitting-Using-Genetic-Algorithm

Curve fitting is the process of constructing a curve or mathematical function that has the best fit to a series
of data points. The most common approach to curve fitting is using the least square approach. However,
despite the widespread use of this approach, it has several drawbacks. One of the drawbacks of the least
square approach is it can only perform reliably when the function at hand is a linear function. Therefore,
for other function types, such as nonlinear functions, we need to come up with a better approach to fit
the curve. Even though attempts are made to form a non-linear least square, it has its own problems. On
the other hand, Genetic Algorithm is known to handle nonlinear and discontinuous functions well.
Therefore, in this study, we will investigate the potentials and limitations of genetic algorithms for the
application of curve fitting.
